# tip-screen

it's a fake tip screen that i had gemini cook up so i can whip it out on people after i reset their password. all self contained into 1 html file with no build step

# usage

on the surface the buttons dont do much but the "Add a tip?" text opens a super secret menu to enter your venmo handle which then makes the buttons create qr codes to pay you an amount you set

# deployment

it's 1 html file, im sure it'll host on vercel or something

# contributing

just make sure you do `npm run format` or i reject your pr
